## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Introduction 
R Markdown is a platform that lets you integrate narrative text, executable R code, and mathematical notation into a single document. This is important for reproducible research and dynamic reporting.

## Narrative Paragraph 
R Markdown makes research analysis and reporting as easy as possible. Instead of copying the results of R over to a report, everything is output directly from your code chunks, which reduces the potential for error and saves a lot of time.

## LaTeX math expression
Inline math: $\alpha + \beta = \gamma$

Displayed equation:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

## R code chunks
```{r load-data}
# Load a dataset
library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)
summary(mpg)
```


## Reflection

R Markdown made it easier to combine code, narrative and equations into one document. Knitting to HTML showed off the high-quality formatting that could accommodate continuing information beyond a plain report. All in all, R Markdown is fast, reproducible and produces professional-looking output.
